Package: libpmem1
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory low level support library, v1 runtime
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This library is provided for software which tracks every store to pmem and
 needs to flush those changes to durability.  Most developers will find higher
 level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more convenient.
 .
 This package provides binary runtime for version 1 of the API.

Package: libpmem1-debug
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory low level support library — debug build
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This package contains a special build of this library meant for debugging
 purposes.  It contains extra logging, assertions and expensive checks that
 should not be used otherwise.

 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This package contains libraries and header files used for linking programs
 against libpmem.

Package: libpmem2
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same

 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This library is provided for software which tracks every store to pmem and
 needs to flush those changes to durability.  Most developers will find higher
 level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more convenient.

Description: Persistent Memory low level support library, v2 headers
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This package contains libraries and header files used for linking programs
 against libpmem2, with a modernized API that avoids certain limitations of
 libpmem1.

 against libpmemobj.

Package: libpmempool1
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libpmem1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory pool management support library
 libpmempool provides a set of utilities for management, diagnostics and repair
 of persistent memory pools.  A pool in this context means a pmemobj pool,
 pmemblk pool, pmemlog pool or BTT layout, independent of the underlying
 storage.  The libpmempool is for applications that need high reliability or
 built-in troubleshooting.  It may be useful for testing and debugging purposes
 also.

Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory management tools
 The main purpose of this package is to provide a user with a set of utilities
 for off-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem libraries.
 .
 The utilities may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators and
 for software developers who work on applications based on these libraries.  The
 latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging purposes also.
